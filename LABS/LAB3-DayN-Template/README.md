# DayN Templates [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
## Overview
This Lab is designed to be a standalone lab to address how to use Onboarding Templates within DNA Center to onboard network devices at Day Zero which is to say no configuration on the device whatsoever.

## General Information
As DNA Center can be used for not only Plug and Play but also Day N or Ongoing Templates customers will start by building out an Onboarding Template which typically deploys only enough information to bring the device up initially. While it might include the entire configuration for a traditional network device, this is better served by Day N Templates as they can be used to apply ongoing changes and to allow device modifications after initial deployment.

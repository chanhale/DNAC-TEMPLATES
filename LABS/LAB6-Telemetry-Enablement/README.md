# Telemetry
## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs 1 through 4 and has been created to address how to properly deal with enabling Telemetry for Assurance with regard to DNA Center. During the lab we will edit the Telemetry settings within DNA Center. This allows DNA Center the ability to configure network devices for the required Telemetry settings required to get the best results when viewing Assurance within DNA Center.

## General Information
Within this lab we will direct Netflow to DNA Center. It is important to understand that some networking devices have minimal allowed Netflow Collectors which can be configured. SHould it be the case that you need addiitional flows to other servers or management devices, then please incorporate a Netflow Redirector in your design. This will allow the same flow to be replicated by the redirector to other management systems which require the feed.

## Lab Section 1 - Enabling Telemetry
In this lab we will enable the Telemetry Settings and Provision the new settings to a device on DNA Center.

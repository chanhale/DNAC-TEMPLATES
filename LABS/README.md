# DNAC-TEMPLATE LABS [![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES)
## Overview
This section of the Repository will be built out in LAB form so as to guide you through the typical steps required to enable the various automation tasks delivered by DNA Center. This lab will give examples of templates used in DNA Center that can be modified for your own use and tested on equipment within the LAB environment. Additional information will be included to hopefully give a well rounded explanation of Automation methods with Templates using DNA Center and flows with both Onboarding and DayN Templates and concepts as well as Application Policy automation on both Wired and Wireless Platforms.

The goal of this repository is a practical guide to allow engineers to rapidly begin using DNAC automation and begin conversion of IOS CLI Templates. The Templates they may have been using over the years and with various use cases and so the intent is to reduce the lift to begin automating.

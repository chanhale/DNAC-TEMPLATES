# Composite Templates
## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs 1 through 3 and has been created to address how to use Regular Templates within DNA Center to onboard network devices at Day 1 through N. This allows Network Administrators the ability to configure network devices in an ongoing and pragmantic manner from within DNA Center without using the SD-Access Fabric methodology.

In this section will go through the flow involved in creating a deployable COmposite Template from an IOS configuration script for a Catalyst switch linking it to a Switch profile and deploy it through DNAC using provisioning workflows.

## General Information
